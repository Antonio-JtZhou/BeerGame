# BeerGame DQN Implementation

This repository provides a Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double DQN implementation for the Beer Game simulation. The Beer Game is a classic supply chain management simulation designed to teach the dynamics of inventory management and order fulfillment. This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to optimize supply chain operations.
